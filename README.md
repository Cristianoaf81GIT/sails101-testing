_create-a-tutorial-app
======================

### How do I create a new tutorial app?

1. Fork this repository.
2. Create a new sails101 tutorial. Try to keep things as conventional and simple as possible- the goal is make these tutorials concise and focused on one particular issue/question at a time (e.g. "How do I use the Jade view engine with Sails?")
3. Please keep the code as simple as possible, and be sure and provide a link to the relevant code file(s) in the README.  Better yet, add some background information and/or a step-by-step guide.
4. When finished, send a pull request to this repository.  One of the moderators will check it out, make sure it works, provide feedback, and potentially suggest some tweaks.  When everything looks good, we'll add the new tutorial to this Github organization.


### Roadmap

The Sails101 community project is still in an experimental stage.  Once we've tested it out a bit, the next step is to automatically parse the repositories in this Github organization, compile them to HTML, and sync them to the new "Guides" section of http://sailsjs.org.
